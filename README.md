# Ali Baba in the Cave

## Description

In the "Ali Baba in the Cave" project, Ali Baba and his team of thieves venture into a cave filled with various types of items. They aim to strategically select a combination of items that maximizes their profit while adhering to constraints such as weight limits and item availability.

## Problem Statement

Ali Baba and his team have a limited load capacity for their Camels and must decide which items to steal to optimize their profit. Each item type is associated with a weight, a profit value, and a specific number of instances available.

## Key Features

- **Item Selection Strategy**: Develop a strategy to select a combination of items that fits within the Camel's load capacity while maximizing overall profit.

- **Constraints Consideration**: Ensure that selected items are taken as whole units (no partial selection) and that the number of instances of each item is respected.

## Implementation

The project involves implementing two crucial functions:

1. **Function#1: Maximum Profit**: Develop a function that returns the maximum profit achievable within the constraints of Camel load capacity and item availability.

2. **Function#2: Item Selection**: Implement a function that returns a list of the items chosen to achieve the maximum profit. The list should also include the number of instances taken from each item.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in the "Ali Baba in the Cave" project, participants will achieve the following learning objectives:

- Develop problem-solving skills in optimizing resource allocation under constraints.

- Gain experience in designing algorithms to maximize profits while considering weight and availability limitations.

- Understand the importance of strategy and decision-making in resource optimization scenarios.

## Outcome

Upon completion, participants will have a functional "Ali Baba in the Cave" algorithm that showcases their ability to optimize resource selection for maximum profit within defined constraints. This project emphasizes skills in algorithmic thinking, problem-solving, and efficient utilization of available resources, which are valuable in various domains such as operations research, finance, and logistics.
